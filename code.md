As an image processing, pattern recognition, and deep learning enthusiast, I have published some of the codes in the fields of image processing and deep learning, which will help others in their teaching and learning processes. I always enjoy writing code in C, C++, Python, or MATLAB.

### Deep Learning

* [**CNNs with NVIDIA Digits**](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~cvlsegmentation/cob/)<br>
Caffe codes for various CNNs are now available for use on NVIDIA DIGITS. Caffe docker containers must be pulled from the NVIDIA NGC cloud and launched on your NVIDIA driver-installed device prior to running these codes.   
 
### Image Processing

* [**Vectorized Image High-boosting OpenCL Kernels**](http://jponttuset.github.io/solving-sudokus-like-a-pro-1/)<br>
Code to capture a camera feed, locate a Sudoku grid, find and recognize the numbers, solve it in real time, and overlay the results.

* [**Image Quality Check**](http://jponttuset.github.io/deep-learning-scraping/)<br>
Demo to answer whether deep learning is indeed in fashion in computer vision. The code scrapes the paper titles of latest vision conferences from the web and computes the percentage of *deep-learning-related* papers.
