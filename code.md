As an image processing, pattern recognition, and deep learning enthusiast, I have published some of the codes in the fields of image processing and deep learning, which will help others in their teaching and learning processes. Most of the codes are written in C, C++, Python, or Matlab.

### Deep Learning

* [**CNNs with NVIDIA Digits**](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~cvlsegmentation/cob/)<br>
State of the art in contour detection, hierarchical segmentation, and object proposals. Runs in 700 miliseconds on a GPU and a single CPU thread, thanks to a novel sparse representation of the segmentation results. From our ECCV 2016 paper.
 
### Image Processing

* [**Vectorized Image High-boosting OpenCL Kernels**](http://jponttuset.github.io/solving-sudokus-like-a-pro-1/)<br>
Code to capture a camera feed, locate a Sudoku grid, find and recognize the numbers, solve it in real time, and overlay the results.

* [**Image Quality Check**](http://jponttuset.github.io/deep-learning-scraping/)<br>
Demo to answer whether deep learning is indeed in fashion in computer vision. The code scrapes the paper titles of latest vision conferences from the web and computes the percentage of *deep-learning-related* papers.
